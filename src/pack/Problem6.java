 * Title :Sum square difference
 * URL : https://projecteuler.net/problem=6
 * Time : Wed, 5 Oct 2016, 20:25
 * Problem Statement : The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
                        12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385

                        The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
                        (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025

        Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers 
        * and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.<br>
 * Goal : Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
